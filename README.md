# DefaultIndustriesPlus
An industry set that enhances the default industries, rather than replacing them with completely new industries, as with most other industry mods.

Main features:
- Extended industry behavior customization options (production change behavior, primary reserves, closure rules, etc.)
- Advanced secondary mechanics (Stockpiling cargo, optional base conversion rates...)
-
