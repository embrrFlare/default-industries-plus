# DefaultIndustriesPlus
An industry set that enhances the default industries, rather than replacing them with completely new industries, as with most other industry mods.
This set features many moduluar and optional mechanics that can be toggled at will to suit your playstyle.

Main features:
- Extended industry behavior customization options (production change behavior, primary reserves, closure rules, etc.)
- Advanced secondary mechanics (Stockpiling cargo, optional base conversion rates...)
- Industry-boosting bonus mechanics (Delivering cargo to bank/power plant, and maintaining high town population)
- Additional cargo and a more centralized cargo chain
